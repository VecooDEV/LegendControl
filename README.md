# LegendControl
Sidemode for [Pixelmon](https://modrinth.com/mod/pixelmon). Changing the spawn elements of legendary Pokémon.

## Features
* Temporary protection of legendary Pokémon from players outside the trust list.
* Changed the spawn of legendary Pokémon.
* Personal notification of the player about the appearance of a legendary Pokémon.
* Ability to disable some mod functionality.
* Blacklist of appearances of legendary Pokémon.

## How does it work?
* Now legendary Pokémon have a base spawn rate, the standard is 10%, and if they spawn unsuccessfully, an additional chance is added, the standard is 5%. The system allows you to compensate for the chance of a long absence of legends.
* There is also a system for protecting legendary Pokémon from theft of other players, with the possibility of a trust list.
